""" Study Drills
    1. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can
       you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and 
       not 2009? (Hint: you can't pick years at random.)
       Jan 1 is the 0th day of 2010. By the end of Jan 1, one full day has 
       passed. Saying that any time before midnight still counts to 2009 is 
       like saying that 0.9 is a negative number.
    2. Write some more lists and work out similar indexes until you can 
       translate them.
    3. Use Python to check your answers.
