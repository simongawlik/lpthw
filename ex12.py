    Look online for what the pydoc command does.
    
    The pydoc module automatically generates documentation from Python modules
    For modules, classes, functions and methods, the displayed documentation is
    derived from the docstring (i.e. the __doc__ attribute) of the object, and
    recursively of its documentable members. If there is no docstring, pydoc 
    tries to obtain a description from the block of comment lines just above 
    the definition of the class, function or method in the source file, or at 
    the top of the module/

    Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. It's alright if you 
    don't understand those; just read through and take notes about interesting
    things.
    
    These are mosly available by importing the libraries.
